# Neural_Network

Feedforward neural network with numerical input and output using only numpy. 

This code was written and adapted in Python from the video tutorial series ["Chapter 10 of The Nature of Code: Neural Networks"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJ7HLz9VYz0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6aCibgK1PTWWu9by6XFdCfh) by "The Coding Train".


Dependencies : 
Python 2 or 3, numpy.

Usage:

- **Neural_Network.**\
Uses the sigmoid function as an activation function. \
You can change lr (learning rate). \
You can add other functions at the beginning of the Neural Network script.

- **Main.**\
input (inp) and target (tar) must have the same dimension. \
The elements inside inp must be of dimension n_input. \
You define the number of nods of the NN with n_input, n_hidden and n_output.
